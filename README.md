# Project Title

## Description
This project contains a single Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. The notebook covers topics such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and plotting using popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook locally, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. In your browser, open the notebook file `analysis.ipynb`.
6. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analysis and visualization. You can execute the cells sequentially to follow along with the analysis or modify the code to explore your own datasets.

## Contributing
